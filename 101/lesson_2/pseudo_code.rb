those strings concatenated together
- save each array element as a string variable
- combine all string variables into a new string variable
- return the new string variable

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every
other element
- set an index variable to equal 0
- create an empty array
- return the element at index 0 via the index variable
- add the returned variable to the new array
- increase the index variable by 2
- return element, and add to new array and increase index variable (like above)
- stop when the index variable is equal or bigger than the original array length
- return the new array
